/**
 * A very naive CSV parser. There are a few weaknesses here.
 *   (1) It assumes that no special cases are present. There will be many valid CSV lines that
 *       this function will parse incorrectly, for many different reasons.
 *       We will have to explore this via testing.
 *   (2) It loses header information, if any is present. It turns a header into another string[],
 *       which gets conflated with the real data. There's also no connection between a column header
 *       and a piece of data: only the index into the array can be used. So the return type isn't great.
 *   (3) It assumes the input is in string form, which is very "eager": a large file would need to be
 *       fully loaded even if we only wanted to get the first row, and an infinite stream of datapoints
 *       couldn't be used at all. We'd like something we can get row-by-row from, on demand.
 *   (4) It is all-or-nothing: I can't just ask for a single datapoint at a time, but instead have to
 *       wait for them all to be extracted and converted. This is related to (3) above, but different.
 *   (5) It has no real error handling: an input with rows containing different numbers of columns would
 *       just produce an array where some of the elements are of different length than others.
 *
 * Note that when we did this in Java, we used the strategy pattern to add a converter function. However,
 * if we aren't shy about using "map", we will assume our caller won't be either.
 *
 * @param input The CSV-formatted data to parse
 * @returns an array of datapoints, each of which is represented as an array of strings (1 for each column)

/*
 * Let's try to resolve some of these issues. First, we'll:
 *   (A) make the parser produce a _generator function_ that the caller can invoke to get a new row each time;
 *   (B) improve the type used for datapoints to make it easier to handle headers; and
 *   (C) let the caller say whether or not a header row is present, and if it is present, keep that information.
 *
 *   We will _not_ attempt to solve the other problems yet. In particular, we'll still use splitting by commas.
 *   We'll also accept strings, rather than using a stream or reader or something more abstract.
 *
 *   The code below introduces another problem: what if a column header is a numeric value? Because TypeScript
 *   object keys are always strings (or internally converted to strings), the index 5 and the column header '5'
 *   will be the same key... To disambiguate, we check each column name and re-write it with a prefix if it
 *   is purely numeric. (Maybe this can be improved on.)
 */

/** This is an "index signature":
 *  {[index: number|string]: string | null}
 *    we don't know what the keys will be called, but their corresponding value must be either a
 *    string or null. We'll use this to map to cell values from either indexes or column names (if present).
 *
 *  Note: don't be tempted to only include the { [index: number|string]: string | null }, which
 *   would allow writing both point['headername'] and point[3]. That seems convenient, but then
 *   how would you easily get meta-data about the datapoint? You could add a field named 'length'
 *   but what if there's a column named that? What next? '_length'? That way lies madness. Avoid it!
 *   (And point.data[3] isn't bad at all.)
 *
 *  We export this so that the caller can use it more easily.

/*
  The 'cell with comma' test showcases that splitting on commas isn't nuanced enough:
  we need to be able to treat the cell value "Hello, world" as a single cell, not as two cells. 
  Moreover, we should be removing un-escaped quotes that wrap these values (i.e., the quotes should 
  not be part of the value we return). 
  
  Further tests represent the other special cases:
  escaping quotes and values with multiple lines in them. 

  To deal with this, we'll only change our parser in two places: 
  the ones where we call `split(',')`. But what should we put there instead? 

  A regular expression is appealing. CSV lines seem regular, so perhaps CSV can 
  be expressed in a regex. However, it turns out to be tough to get it right. 
  And it might be slower than other methods, because of the subtleties caused 
  by escaping quotes, etc.

  Between these three regexes, pick the one that you believe will work for the 
  cases above:
  
    - /(?:[^",]|"[^"]*")+/
    - /,(?=(?:[^"]*"[^"]*")*[^"]*$)/
    - /(?:[^,"]+|"(?:[^"]|"")*")/g
